My name is Slim, and I am a computer scientist. Depending on my mood I am either a software engineer at [Notion](https://notion.so) or a PhD student at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com/) under the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Fellowship.

My research interests span programming languages, human factors, and learning sciences.
I study _programming languages as user interfaces_: in short, how the syntactic and semantic properties of a language shape the way people reason about and write programs in the real world. 
For instance, I ask questions about the usability of rich type systems, designing (co)algebraic abstractions for UI programming, and how different evaluation strategies might promote or hinder program comprehension in educational settings. As both an academic and practitioner, my goal is to _meaningfully improve the state of practice_ via theoretically compelling formalisms, substantiated by rigorous empirical methods and user-centered design.

Previously I collaborated with [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) on rich text CRDTs; helped build tools for personal computing as an early engineer at [Notion](https://notion.so/about); worked in the [Early Product Development](https://early.khanacademy.org/) group at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org); and interned with the [Human Experience and Design](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/future-of-work/) group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

I received my BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://northwestern.edu), concentrating in human-computer interaction and theoretical computer science.
My studies were supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship), and others, for which I am grateful, though these companies do not necessarily represent my views.
During undergrad I was affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/), where I researched [CSS inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2dFxxBh2K4) with my co-advisors [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O&rsquo;Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com). My work on [semantic dependencies in CSS inspection](assets/papers/ply-uist.pdf) was incorporated into both  the [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/firefox-70-a-bountiful-release-for-all/#developertools) and [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/new-in-devtools-108/#css-hint) DevTools, and received Best Paper Honorable Mention at [UIST 2018](https://uist.acm.org/uist2018/).
- [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/), where I researched [peer grading algorithms](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1733860) with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline).
- [Center for Connected Learning](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/), where I worked on [NetLogo Web](https://netlogoweb.org/) with [Jason Bertsche](https://github.com/TheBizzle).

I have a lot of hobbies:

- I am a classically-trained flutist, currently studying with [Evan Pengra Sult](https://blogpnborg.wordpress.com/2020/12/14/letters-from-pnb-artists-evan-pengra-sult-pnb-orchestra-member/).

- My goal is to ride every Amtrak long-distance route with a West Coast terminus. So far I’ve ridden the [California Zephyr](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/california-zephyr-train.html) twice, [Coast Starlight](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/coast-starlight-train.html) seven times, and the [Sunset Limited](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/sunset-limited-train.html) and [Empire Builder](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/empire-builder-train.html) once each.

- Policy debate is a [niche](https://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff-debateteam/), [all-consuming](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/11/revenge-nerds/), and [occasionally-fraught](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/debatable) subculture that defined my adolescent and early adult identity. I founded the [Interlake Policy Debate](https://www.facebook.com/InterlakeDebate/) team, which continues to be nationally successful more than ten years later, and was part of the [Northwestern Debate Society](https://communication.northwestern.edu/debate-society/) during our historic [15th national championship](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2015/04/northwestern-debate-society-wins-record-15th-title). Debate has shaped me profoundly, and bootstrapping a high school team with no resources or coaching remains the hardest thing I have ever accomplished.
